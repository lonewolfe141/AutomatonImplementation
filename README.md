# Automaton Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates three types of automata:
1. DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)
2. NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton)
3. PDA (Pushdown Automaton)

## Features
- DFA: Simulates a DFA that accepts strings consisting of four 'a's followed by an odd number of 'b's.
- NFA: Simulates an NFA that accepts strings either ending with 'ab' or starting with 'ab' and have at least four characters.
- PDA: Simulates a PDA that accepts strings defined by the language **L = aab\*aba\*ab**.

## Requirements
